React Compiler is a build-time only tool that automatically optimizes your React app. When using Unistyles with React Compiler, it's necessary to configure it properly.

# With Expo
Follow official [expo guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/react-compiler/), no changes are required!

# With bare React Native
Follow official [react guide](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler#usage-with-babel) with a one major difference:

It is crucial that React Compiler is run *after* Unistyles Babel plugin. Otherwise, issues will occur.

It is due to the fact that Unistyles must parse `Variants` before React Compiler. You can learn more about how the Babel plugin works [here](/v3/other/babel-plugin)

```diff lang="js" title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = function () {
  return {
    plugins: [
      ['react-native-unistyles/plugin'], // Must run before react-compiler
+      'babel-plugin-react-compiler',
      // Rest of the plugins
    ]
  }
}
```
