React Compiler is a build-time tool that automatically optimizes your React app. To integrate Unistyles with React Compiler, proper configuration is essential.

## With Expo

For Expo projects, simply follow the [official Expo guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/react-compiler/). No additional configuration changes are necessary!

## With Bare React Native

For bare React Native projects, refer to the [official React guide](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler#usage-with-babel) with one key adjustment:

Ensure that the React Compiler runs *after* the Unistyles Babel plugin. Failure to do so may result in errors because Unistyles needs to process `Variants` before the React Compiler does. You can read more about the Babel plugin [here](/v3/other/babel-plugin).

Here's a sample configuration for your `babel.config.js`:

```diff lang="js" title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = function () {
  return {
    plugins: [
      ['react-native-unistyles/plugin'], // Must run before react-compiler
+     'babel-plugin-react-compiler',
      // Add other plugins here
    ]
  }
}
```
