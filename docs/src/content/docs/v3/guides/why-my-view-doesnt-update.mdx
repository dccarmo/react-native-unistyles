If you start working with Unistyles 3.0, it might be unclear why some views are updated while others aren't.
Before diving into this guide, make sure you've read the other guides covering the basics of the new Unistyles:

- [Look under the hood](/v3/start/how-unistyles-works)
- [Merging styles](/v3/guides/merging-styles)
- [Babel plugin](/v3/other/babel-plugin)

### Problem 1: Babel

To leverage ShadowTree updates and avoid unnecessary re-renders, Unistyles must process both `StyleSheets` and your components.
By default, the Babel plugin looks for `react-native-unistyles` imports and always ignores the `node_modules` folder.

If you separate `StyleSheets` from your components, it's your responsibility to configure Babel to detect components that lack a Unistyles import.
We've added plenty of options, so be sure to [check them out](/v3/other/babel-plugin##extra-configuration).

### Problem 2: Dependency detection


Unistyles will automatically detect all your dependencies for every `StyleSheet`, but there's a chance you used custom syntax that isn't covered by the plugin.
If Babel fails to detect some style dependencies, they won't be updated when necessary.

You can easily debug this issue by adding the following Babel plugin configuration:

```js title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true)

  return {
    // other config
    plugins: [
        // other plugins
        ['react-native-unistyles/plugin', {
            debug: true
        }]
    ]
  }
}
```
