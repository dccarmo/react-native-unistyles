[Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) is a popular routing library from Expo that is built on top of React Navigation. When using Unistyles with Expo Router, it's necessary to configure it properly.

### Modify main entry

Expo Router resolves routes differently that expected. Also, Unistyles 3.0 is parsing your `StyleSheets` as soon as you import file containing it.
This combination may cause some issues. To prevent that you need to modify your main entry file:

```diff lang="json" title="package.json"
{
-   "main": "expo-router/entry"
+   "main": "index.ts"
}
```

Then, create `index.ts` file with following content:

```js title="index.ts"
import 'expo-router/entry'
import './unistyles' // <-- file that initializes Unistyles
```

<Aside>
The `unistyles.ts` file is where Unistyles is configured. For more details, refer to the [configuration guide](/v3/start/configuration).
</Aside>

With this setup, we will ensure that Unistyles is initialized before any other component.

### Static rendering

If you're using Expo Router with static rendering for the web, you also need to import the Unistyles initialization file in the `+html.tsx` file:

```diff lang="tsx" title="+html.tsx"
import React from 'react'
import { ScrollViewStyleReset } from 'expo-router/html'
import { type PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
+ import '../unistyles' // <-- file that initializes Unistyles

export default function Root({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {}
```

It ensures that initialization of Unistyles is called whenever Expo Router tries to render next static page.
