It's possible to render Unistyles without `react-native-web` dependency by simply creating your own web-only components.

Unfortunately, you still need to install `react-native-web` in order to run your app, because most of the react native libraries are not working without it.

For this we recommend following the guidelines provided by [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/web/).

## How to create custom web components

In order to create custom web components, you need to use `getWebProps` function. It takes a `StyleProp` and returns an object with `className` and `ref` properties.

```tsx title="src/components/Header.tsx"
import { Text, StyleProp, TextStyle } from 'react-native'
import { getWebProps } from 'react-native-unistyles/web-only'

type HeaderProps = {
    style: StyleProp<TextStyle>
    children: string
}

export const Header: React.FC<HeaderProps> = ({ style, children }) => {
    const unistyleProps = getWebProps(style)

    return (
        <h1 {...unistyleProps}>
            {children}
        </h1>
    )
}
```

Thats it! Now you can use your custom web components in your app.
