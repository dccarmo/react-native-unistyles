Unistyles is a cross-platform library that enables you to share up to 100% of your styles across all platforms.
It combines the simplicity of `StyleSheet` with the performance of `C++`.

**`Unistyles` is a superset of `StyleSheet`** similar to how `TypeScript` is a superset of `JavaScript`.
If you're familiar with styling in React Native, then you already know how to use `Unistyles`.

### Why should you use Unistyles?

- Guarantees no re-renders across the entire app (no hooks, no context‚Äîjust pure JSI bindings)
- Doesn't pollute your native view hierarchy (Unistyles has no component wrappers)
- Includes a cross-platform parser written in C++, ensuring consistent output across all platforms
- Leverages [Nitro Modules](https://nitro.margelo.com/) under the hood (everything is strongly typed!)
- Transforms your `StyleSheets` into enhanced `StyleSheets` with superpowers ü¶∏üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è that can access themes, platform-specific values, and more!
- Loved by developers worldwide: 1.3M+ downloads and over 1.8K stars on GitHub
