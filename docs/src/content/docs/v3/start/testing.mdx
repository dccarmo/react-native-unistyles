Unistyles provides its own mocks to help you test your components. Follow this guide to learn how to use them.

### Including Mocks

You don't need to mock anything manually, as Unistyles supplies all necessary mocks for its core and for `NitroModules`.
To use them, simply include `react-native-unistyles/mocks` in your `jest.setup.ts` file.

```tsx title="package.json"
{
    "jest": {
        "preset": "jest-expo",  // or use own config for bare react native
        "setupFiles": [
            "react-native-unistyles/mocks"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Include Unistyles Configuration

Each `StyleSheet` requires a configuration object passed to the `StyleSheet.configure` function. This is also true in the test environment.
Extend the configuration from the previous step by including the file where you configure Unistyles.

```tsx title="package.json"
{
    "jest": {
        "preset": "jest-expo",
        "setupFiles": [
            "react-native-unistyles/mocks",
            "./unistyles.ts" // provide the correct path to your Unistyles configuration file
        ]
    }
}
```
<Aside type="caution">
You must include configuration file **after** the mocks as they provide all necessary stubs for `StyleSheet.configure`.

### Babel Plugin

The Babel plugin is automatically disabled in the `jest` test environment or when `NODE_ENV === 'test'`.
