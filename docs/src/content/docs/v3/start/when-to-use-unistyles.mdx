This guide will explain when you should consider using Unistyles and when it's not the best option.

### When should you use Unistyles?

Unistyles is recommended for projects that:
- leverage the New Architecture and care about performance and memory usage
- use two or more themes (we support an unlimited number of themes and [adaptive themes](/v3/guides/theming#adaptive-themes))
- require rendering on the web (we [auto-generate](/v3/references/web-styles) CSS classes and variables)
- want to use [variants](/v3/references/variants) and [compound variants](/v3/references/compound-variants)
- want to use pseudo-classes and custom web styles ([learn more](/v3/references/web-only))
- feel confident with the styling patterns introduced by React Native (Unistyles follows the same approach)
- don't want to pollute your native view hierarchy

### When is Unistyles not the best option?

- You're looking for a component library (Unistyles has no components, instead we encourage you to build your own design system specifically tailored to your project)
- You use Tailwind on the web, as Unistyles has no native bindings to process `classNames` on native side. Instead, we recommend using [Nativewind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)
- You're building a super simple app that doesn't require theme changes or any advanced features. In this case, stick with React Native's `StyleSheet` and consider updating to Unistyles 3.0 when it will be more efficient

### When you can't use Unistyles 3.0?

- In Expo Go apps, as Unistyles is not (yet) selected by the Expo team
- In apps that canâ€™t update to the New Architecture. Instead, consider using [Unistyles 2.0](https://v2.unistyl.es/start/introduction/)
- In apps that targets unsupported platforms (eg. TV, Windows, macOS etc.), again consider using [Unistyles 2.0](https://v2.unistyl.es/start/introduction/)
