### Can I run Unistyles on Expo Go?

No, Unistyles includes custom native code, which means it does not support Expo Go.

### What happened to `macOS`, `windows`, `visionOS`, `tvOS` support?

For now they're not available. We're seeking sponsors to help us add support, as they are rarely used by our customers.

### Can I run Unistyles on `Old Architecture`?

No, Unistyles is tightly integrated with `Fabric`. There are no plans to support `Old Architecture`.

### We are not ready to upgrade. What will happen with version `2.0`?

We understand that some apps require more time to migrate to the `New Architecture`. We plan to support Unistyles 2.0 for a few more months or stable React Native versions.

### Adaptive mode doesn’t work for me

To enable adaptive mode, you need to register two themes named `light` and `dark` and set the `adaptiveThemes` flag to true within `StyleSheet.configure`.

If your app still doesn’t automatically switch themes, ensure that:

- For Expo your `app.json` contains a `userInterfaceStyle` key with the value automatic
- For bare React Native, your `Info.plist` does not have the `UIUserInterfaceStyle` key set to a hardcoded value
- `Appearance` from `react-native` is set to null
- You have phone with iOS 15+ or Android 10+
- Your device supports dark mode
