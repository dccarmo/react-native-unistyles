Unistyles 3.0 relies heavily on the Babel plugin, which helps convert your code in a way that allows binding the `ShadowNode` with `Unistyle`. Before reading this guide, make sure to check the [Look under the hood](/v3/start/how-unistyles-works) guide.

Our golden rule is to never introduce any component that could pollute your native view hierarchy. In other words, if you use a `View`, it will be rendered as-is in the native view hierarchy.

Let's discuss the responsibilities of the Babel plugin:

### 1. Detecting StyleSheet dependencies

Each `StyleSheet` is different. One might rely on a `theme`, another on `miniRuntime`, and so on.
The same applies to `styles`. Each style depends on different things. For example, you can wrap your app in a `View` that safeguards your app from rendering behind the notch or navigation bar.
Another style might be used in your `Typography` component and provides text color based on the apps' theme.

Should the `Typography` style re-calculate on an `insets` change? Or should the `View` that relies on insets re-render on a theme change?

We don't think that's a good idea. The first responsibility of the Babel plugin is to detect all dependencies in your `StyleSheet`. This ensures that only the relevant styles are recalculated when necessary.

```ts
// Babel: depends on theme
const stylesheet = StyleSheet.create(theme => ({
    container: {
        // Babel: depends on theme
        backgroundColor: theme.colors.background
    },
    text: {
        // Babel: static (no dependencies)
        fontSize: 12
    }
}))
```

```ts
// Babel: depends on theme and miniRuntime
const stylesheet = StyleSheet.create((theme, rt) => ({
    container: {
        // Babel: depends on theme and insets
        paddingTop: rt.insets.top,
        paddingBottom: rt.insets.bottom,
        backgroundColor: theme.colors.background
    },
    text: (fontSize: number) => ({
        // Babel: depends on theme
        color: theme.colors.text,
        // Babel: depends on fontScale
        fontSize: rt.fontScale >= 3
            ? fontSize * 1.5
            : fontSize * 0.8
    })
}))
```


### 2. Attaching unique id to each StyleSheet

This helps us identify your `StyleSheet` while you're developing your app and trigger multiple `hot-reloads`. Such identification is required to swap your `StyleSheet` with another one, ensuring that you get up-to-date values during reloads.
This feature does not affect your app in production, as the bundle never reloads in that environment.

### 3. Modifying your component `style` prop

Each `Unistyle` (C++ HybridObject) has an attached `C++` state. This state can be lost when using the spread operator, which is why Unistyles safeguards against that.

If we try to read the style on C++ side without its associated state, an error will be thrown: `Unistyle is not bound!`.

However, this doesn't mean you can't copy or spread your styles. It is still possible to do so, but it requires the Babel plugin, which converts your styles into an array format.

```ts
// ðŸ˜© ouch, you have just removed C++ state
const mergedStyles = {
    ...styles.container,
    ...styles.text
}

// ðŸ’¥ Unistyle is not bound!
<View style={mergedStyles} />
```

```ts
// ðŸ˜Ž you're safe
const mergedStyles = [
    styles.container,
    styles.text
]

// ðŸ˜‡ we can read the state
<View style={mergedStyles} />
```

Or with babel plugin:

```ts
<View style={{...styles.container, ...styles.text}} />

// ðŸ˜‡ will be replaced with
<View style={[styles.container, styles.text]} />
```

### 4. Component factory

This is the most crucial partâ€”without it, Unistyles wonâ€™t be able to update your views from C++.
In the early versions of Unistyles 3.0, we tried solving this problem by using the `ref` prop, but it wasnâ€™t reliable enough.
Many developers use different style syntaxes, making it impossible to support all of them.

Instead, we decided to leave the userâ€™s `ref` as is and transfer the implementation from Babel to our component factory.
This way we have more control and we have an unified way of registering your `ShadowNodes`.

The component factory is a function that takes your component and renders it with an overridden `ref` prop:

```ts
const factory = Component => <Component ref={someMagicâœ¨} {...props} />;
```

<Aside>
We override your `ref` prop to connect a `ShadowNode` to the attached Unistyle(s).
From the runtime perspective, your component will render the same way as before!
We only borrow your `ref` momentarily to update the ShadowRegistry.

Weâ€™re also React 19â€“ready and will call your `ref` cleanup function if itâ€™s present.
</Aside>


Letâ€™s go through some examples so you can better understand how this works:

```ts title="Your code"
import { View } from 'react-native'

const ref = useRef()

<View ref={ref} />
```

```ts title="Babel transform"
import { View } from 'react-native-unistyles/src/components/native/View'

const ref = useRef()

// no changes
<View ref={ref} />
```

We also support other components to extract `ShadowNode` from them:

```ts title="Your code"
import { Pressable, Image } from 'react-native'

<Pressable
    ref={ref => {
        doSomething(ref)
    }}
    onPress={() => {}}
/>
<Image source={require('./image.png')} style={styles.image} ref={ref2} />
```

```ts title="Babel transform"
import { Pressable } from 'react-native-unistyles/components/native/Pressable'
import { Image } from 'react-native-unistyles/components/native/Image'

// no changes
<Pressable
    ref={ref => {
        doSomething(ref)
    }}
    onPress={() => {}}
/>
<Image source={require('./image.png')} style={styles.image} ref={ref2} />
```


### Summary

That's it! We hope you enjoy the DX of Unistyles 3.0 with the help of the Babel plugin. If you encounter any Babel issues, we're ready to tackle them and resolve them with priority!
