In Unistyles 2.0, developers could retrieve the `breakpoint` value from the `useStyles` hook.
This was helpful for hiding certain JSX components based on specific screen sizes.

However, this pattern was a bit tedious, as it required writing custom logic to determine whether a component should be visible or not.

With Unistyles 3.0, preferred way of listening for breakpoint changes is with `Display` and `Hide` components.

### Display

The Display component helps you show  its children based on `breakpoints` or `media queries`.

```tsx /Display/
import React from 'react'
import { View } from 'react-native'
import { Display, mq } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const Component = () => {
    return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
            <Display mq={mq.only.width('sm')}>
                <View style={styles.text}>
                    I will be visible from 'sm' breakpoint and up
                </View>
            </Display>
        </View>
    )
}
```

You can also use pixel-based values:

```tsx /Display/
import React from 'react'
import { View } from 'react-native'
import { Display, mq } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const Component = () => {
    return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
            <Display mq={mq.only.width(0, 500)}>
                <View style={styles.text}>
                    I will be visible from 0 to 500px
                </View>
            </Display>
        </View>
    )
}
```

### Hide

On the opposite side, the `Hide` component helps you hide its children based on `breakpoints` or `media queries`.
It works exactly the same way as the Display component.

```tsx /Hide/
import React from 'react'
import { View } from 'react-native'
import { Hide, mq } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const Component = () => {
    return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
            <Hide mq={mq.only.width('sm', 'lg')}>
                <View style={styles.text}>
                    I will be hidden from 'sm' breakpoint to 'lg' breakpoint
                </View>
            </Hide>
        </View>
    )
}

```

<Aside type="caution">
Does it mean that Unistyles introduced a new components?

Well, no! These components are simple if-else statements used to conditionally render your JSX. We wonâ€™t wrap your components in any additional layers.

We believe this saves you a lot of time and effort, eliminating the need to implement the logic yourself or causing re-renders by listening to any hooks.
