### iOS

Unistyles uses native `SafeAreaInsets` API to handle insets on iOS.
This API is stable and works the same across all iOS versions.

Most likely you'll never get a wrong value for insets on iOS.


### Android

Unistyles uses `WindowsInsetsCompat` API to handle insets on Android. This API requires your app to have edge to edge layout enabled.
In other words, it means that your `StatusBar` is always `translucent` and the app can draw behind the `NavigationBar`. A translucent status bar is also the default when you build your app with Expo. To leverage `WindowInsetsCompat`, Unistyles enables `edgeToEdge` layout by default.

As a result you need to use paddings to draw your app content above system bars. To learn more about `edgeToEdge` layout please check [Window insets in Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/insets).

```tsx /rt.insets.*/
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const App = () => (
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
            Correct insets
        </Text>
    </View>
)

const styles = StyleSheet.create((theme, rt) => ({
    container: {
        backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
        flex: 1,
        // apply insets to the container,
        // so it will add required paddings
        paddingTop: rt.insets.top,
        paddingBottom: rt.insets.bottom,
        paddingLeft: rt.insets.left,
        paddingRight: rt.insets.right
    },
})
```

<Aside title="Edge-to-edge enforcement">
Apps are edge-to-edge by default on devices running Android 15 if the app is targeting Android 15 (API level 35).

<Aside type="caution">
Unistyles enables `edgeToEdge` by default, but sometimes other libraries might interfere with it.
We decided to depend on `react-native-edge-to-edge` package, to help reduce these issues. Learn more [here](/v3/other/dependencies#react-native-edge-to-edge).
