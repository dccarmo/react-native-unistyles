Breakpoints are user-defined key/value pairs that describe the boundaries of screen sizes.
There's no limit to the number of breakpoints; you can define as many as you want.

### Register breakpoints

To register your breakpoints, create an object with **any** keys:

```tsx
// unistyles.ts
const breakpoints = {
    xs: 0,
    sm: 576,
    md: 768,
    lg: 992,
    xl: 1200,
    superLarge: 2000,
    tvLike: 4000
} as const
```

The first breakpoint **must** start with `0`. This is required to simulate CSS cascading, e.g., everything below 576px (`sm` breakoint)
will resolve to `xs` breakpoint.

If you use TypeScript you need to override the library's type:

```tsx /name/
type AppBreakpoints = typeof breakpoints

declare module 'react-native-unistyles' {
  export interface UnistylesBreakpoints extends AppBreakpoints {}
}
```

Finally, to register the breakpoints, call `StyleSheet.configure`:

```tsx /addBreakpoints/
import { UnistylesRegistry } from 'react-native-unistyles'

StyleSheet.configure({
    breakpoints
})
```

To learn more follow configuration [guide](/v3/start/configuration).

### How to use breakpoints?

Any style can change based on breakpoints. To do this, change a `value` to an `object`:

```diff lang="tsx" /xs/ /sm/ del="backgroundColor: theme.colors.background" ins="backgroundColor: {"
const styles = StyleSheet.create(theme => ({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
        backgroundColor: {
+            // your breakpoints
+            xs: theme.colors.background,
+            sm: theme.colors.barbie
+        }
    },
    text: {
        color: theme.colors.typography
    }
}))
```

You can even use it with nested objects like `transform`,  `shadowOffset` or `filters`:

```ts /xs/ /sm/ /xl/
const styles = StyleSheet.create(theme => ({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: {
            xs: theme.colors.background,
            sm: theme.colors.barbie
        },
        transform: [
            {
                translateX: 100
            },
            {
                scale: {
                    xs: 1.5,
                    xl: 0.9
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}))
```

Breakpoints are also available with [variants](/v3/references/variants/) and [compound variants](/v3/references/compound-variants/).


### Built-in breakpoints `landscape` and `portrait`

Even if you don't use custom breakpoints, you can still utilize Unistyles' predefined breakpoints available on mobile devices: `portrait` and `landscape`.

- `portrait` will resolve to your device's width in portrait mode
- `landscape` will resolve to your device's width in landscape mode

:::tip
These breakpoints are only available on mobile unless you register your own.
:::

```ts /landscape/ /portrait/
const styles = StyleSheet.create(theme => ({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
        backgroundColor: {
            landscape: theme.colors.background,
            portrait: theme.colors.barbie
        }
    }
}))
```

### Pixel/Point mode for native breakpoints

By default, Unistyles will use `pixels` for native breakpoints. This means that the breakpoints and [mq](/v3/references/media-queries) will be computed based on mobile screen pixels.
You can change this behavior by setting `nativeBreakpointsMode` to `points` in your [configuration](/v3/start/configuration#settings-optional).

If `nativeBreakpointsMode` is set to `points` all breakpoints and `mq` will be computed based on mobile screen points (screen in pixels divided by pixel ratio).


### Show/Hide your components based on breakpoints

In order to show or hide your components based on the screen size, you can leverage the `mq` utility and one of the two built-in components: `Display` and `Hide`.

```tsx
import { Display, Hide, mq } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
        <Display mq={mq.only.width(0, 400)}>
            <Text>This text is visible on small devices</Text>
        </Display>
        <Hide mq={mq.only.width(400)}>
            <Text>This text is hidden on big devices</Text>
        </Hide>
    )
}
```

You can also access your current breakpoint with `UnistylesRuntime`:

```tsx /UnistylesRuntime.breakpoint/
import { UnistylesRuntime } from 'react-native-unistyles'

// check the current breakpoint
export const CurrentBreakpoint = () => (
    <Text>
        Current breakpoint is {UnistylesRuntime.breakpoint}
    </Text>
)
```

### Get registered breakpoints

Access your registered breakpoints object with `UnsitylesRuntime`:

```tsx /UnistylesRuntime.breakpoints/
import { UnistylesRuntime } from 'react-native-unistyles'

// check the registered breakpoints
export const RegisteredBreakpoints = () => (
    <Text>
        My registered breakpoint are {JSON.stringify(UnistylesRuntime.breakpoints)}
    </Text>
)
```
