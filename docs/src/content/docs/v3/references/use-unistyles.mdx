Unistyles provides a way to access your app's theme and runtime within your components through a hook.

:::caution
We strongly recommend **not using** this hook, as it will re-render your component on every change. This hook was created to simplify the migration process and should only be used when other methods fail.

Follow our [decision algorithm](/v3/references/3rd-party-views) to learn when to use this hook.
:::

### When to use it?

If you're using `react-native`, `react-native-reanimated`, or `react-native-gesture-handler` components, you should avoid this hook. Unistyles updates these views via the ShadowTree without causing **any re-renders**.

Consider using this hook only if:
- You need to update a view in a third-party library like `react-native-blurhash`
- You've already tried using [withUnistyles](/v3/references/with-unistyles) without success

### How to use it?

This is a standard hook that exposes `theme` and `rt` (runtime) properties. You can import it from `react-native-unistyles`:

```tsx
import { useUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const { theme, rt } = useUnistyles()

    return (
        // your view
    )
}
```

### Why isn't it recommended?

We encourage using `withUnistyles` instead because it ensures only a single component is re-rendered instead of multiple components or the entire app. If you use this hook in a root component, you lose all the benefits of ShadowTree updates and trigger full app re-renders on every change.

Learn more about [How Unistyles works?](/v3/start/how-unistyles-works) to understand why this is not ideal.

Another advantage of `withUnistyles` is that it tracks style dependencies, ensuring only components with changed dependencies are re-rendered. In contrast, `useUnistyles` will re-render the component whenever `theme` or `rt` properties change. Note that `runtime` contains multiple values that can change frequently during your app's lifecycle.

### How to use it correctly?

If you must use this hook, follow these best practices:

#### 1. Use it only for a single component
```tsx
import { useUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'
import Icon from 'react-native-cool-icons/MaterialIcons'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const { theme } = useUnistyles()

    // Ensure this component has no children
    return (
        <Icon color={theme.colors.primary} />
    )
}
```

Like `withUnistyles`, create a new component and use the hook there. Avoid using this hook in your root component or screen, as it will cause unnecessary re-renders for other components.

#### 2. Use it with `react-navigation` components like `Stack` or `Tabs`
```tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router'

export default function Layout() {
    const { theme } = useUnistyles()

    return (
        <Stack
            screenOptions={{
                headerStyle: {
                    backgroundColor: theme.colors.background
                }
            }}
        >
            <Stack.Screen name="home" />
        </Stack>
    )
}
```

This is allowed because `react-navigation` does not re-render screens on style prop change. Note that using `withUnistyles` instead may generate a warning since `Stack` components won't allow other external components.

#### 3. Migration from Unistyles 2.0
If you're migrating from version 2.0 to 3.0, you can use `useUnistyles` to access the theme and runtime in your components. This works similarly to the `useStyles` hook in 2.0. Once migration is complete, refactor your code to align with Unistyles 3.0 principles.

### Bad Practices

#### 1. Using it with complex components:
```tsx
import { useUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'
import { Blurhash } from 'react-native-blurhash'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const { theme } = useUnistyles()

    return (
        <View>
            <Component1 />
            <Component2 />
            <ComponentN />
            <Blurhash
                blurhash="LGFFaXYk^6#M@-5c,1J5@[or[Q6."
                style={{
                    backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary
                }}
            />
        </View>
    )
}
```
This will re-render multiple components unnecessarily. Instead move `Blurhash` to a separate component and use `withUnistyles` there.

#### 2. Using it at the root level:
```tsx
import { useUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const MyApp = () => {
    const { theme } = useUnistyles()

    return (
        <View>
            <App />
        </View>
    )
}
```
Using the hook at the root level eliminates all Unistyles benefits, causing your app to re-render unnecessarily.

#### 3. Using it with `react-native` components:
```tsx
import { useUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'
import { Text } from 'react-native'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const { theme } = useUnistyles()

    return (
        <Text style={{ color: theme.colors.primary }}>
            Hello world
        </Text>
    )
}
```
This is a bad practice. Unistyles updates `react-native` components through the ShadowTree without re-rendering. Using this hook here will cause unnecessary re-renders. Once again follow our [decision algorithm](/v3/references/3rd-party-views) to learn about another options.
