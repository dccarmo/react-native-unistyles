Before reading this guide, make sure that you understand [How Unistyles works](/v3/start/how-unistyles-works) and how [Babel plugin](/v3/other/babel-plugin)
manipulates your code. Also read our [decision algorithm](/v3/references/3rd-party-views) to learn when to use this factory.

### Why do you need it?

- Unistyles cannot retrieve `ShadowNode` from third-party components because they might not expose a native view via the ref prop

```ts
import { Blurhash } from 'react-native-blurhash'

const MyComponent = () => {
    return
        <Blurhash
            blurhash="LGFFaXYk^6#M@-5c,1J5@[or[Q6."
            // ðŸ’¥ Oops! Blurhash is 3rd party view, that might not expose the `ref` prop
            // it will never update when theme changes
            style={styles.container}
        />
    }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create(theme => ({
    container: {
        borderWidth: 1,
        borderColor: theme.colors.primary
    }
}))
```

- Another use case is when you use components that do not expect a `style` prop but require, for example, a `color` prop.

```ts
import { Button } from 'react-native'

const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
        <Button
            // ðŸ’¥ Oops! Button is React Native component, so it has a ref, but it doesn't expect `style` prop
            // it will never update when theme changes
            // Also, from where will we get `theme` value?
            color={theme.colors.primary}
        />
    )
}
```

Thatâ€™s why we created a way to subscribe such component to Unistyles updates.

<Aside>
This pattern is only recommended when you need an escape hatch to use Unistyles with third-party components.
If you don't rely on styles in these components, you should not wrap your component with `withUnistyles`.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
`withUnistyles` detects automatically your component dependencies and re-renders it only when they change.
</Aside>

### Auto mapping for `style` and `contentContainerStyle` props

If your component expects the `style` or `contentContainerStyle` prop, Unistyles will automatically handle the mapping under the hood.
You just need to wrap your custom view in `withUnistyles`. We will also respect your style dependencies, so, for example, the `Blurhash` component will only re-render when the theme changes.


```ts
import { Blurhash } from 'react-native-blurhash'
import { withUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'

// âœ¨ Magic auto mapping
const UniBlurHash = withUnistyles(Blurhash)

const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
        <UniBlurHash
            blurhash="LGFFaXYk^6#M@-5c,1J5@[or[Q6."
            // now Blurhash will re-render when theme changes
            style={styles.container}
        />
    )
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create(theme => ({
    container: {
        borderWidth: 1,
        // blurhash depends on theme
        borderColor: theme.colors.primary
    }
}))
```

### Mapping custom props to Unistyles styles

If you need to ensure your component updates but it doesnâ€™t use `style` or `contentContainerStyle` props, you can use `mappings`:

```ts
import { Button } from 'react-native'
import { withUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'

// âœ¨ Some magic happens under the hood
const UniButton = withUnistyles(Button, (theme, rt) => ({
    // map `primary` color to `color` prop
    color: theme.colors.primary
    // any other props that Button supports
}))

const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
        // you don't need to specify color props here
        <UniButton />
    )
}
```

TypeScript will autocomplete all your props, so there is no need to specify type manually.

### Custom mappings for external props

Sometimes, you might want to map your props based on a function or value that is only accessible within the component.
For example, if you are using `FlashList` and want to modify the `numColumns` prop based on a condition. Using `mappings` in `withUnistyles` is not an option because it doesn't allow referencing other props.

```tsx /getNumColumns/
import { withUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'
import { FlashList } from 'react-native-flash-list'

const MyFlashList = withUnistyles(FlashList, (theme, rt) => ({
    numColumns: ðŸ’¥ Oops! getNumColumns function is not available here
}))

const MyComponent = () => {
    const getNumColumns = () => {
        // your logic
    }

    return (
        <MyFlashList />
    )
}
```

Another example is React Native's `Switch` component:

```tsx /isDisabled/
import { Switch } from 'react-native'
import { withUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const MySwitch = withUnistyles(Switch, (theme, rt) => ({
    trackColor: ðŸ’¥ Opps! isDisabled prop is not available here
}))

const MyComponent = ({ isDisabled }) => {
    return (
        <MySwitch />
    )
}
```

For such dynamic mappings, we provide a prop called `uniProps` that allows you to pass any props to the component.
From there, you can access any function or variable or map the prop to any value based on your state and needs.

```tsx /(theme, rt)/
import { Switch } from 'react-native'
import { withUnistyles } from 'react-native-unistyles'

// leave it empty here
const MySwitch = withUnistyles(Switch)

const MyComponent = ({ isDisabled }) => {
    return (
        <MySwitch
            uniProps={(theme, rt) => ({
                trackColor: isDisabled
                    ? theme.colors.disabled
                    : theme.colors.primary
            })}
        />
    )
}
```

`uniProps` is a function that receives `theme` and `rt` as arguments. These values will be always up-to-date, so you can use them to map colors or value to new props.

<Aside>
Components that use `uniProps` are also aware of your dependencies. In the example above, `MySwitch` will re-render only when `theme` changes.
</Aside>

### Props resolution priority

We will respect your order of prop resolution, applying them with the following priority:

1. Global mappings
2. `uniProps`
3. Inline props

**Example: Modifying a Button**

```ts
// By default, Button is red
const UniButton = withUnistyles(Button, theme => ({
    color: theme.colors.red
}))

// `uniProps` have higher priority,
// so the button is orange
<UniButton
    uniProps={theme => ({
       color: theme.colors.orange
    })}
/>

// Inline props have the highest priority,
// so Button is pink
<UniButton
    color="pink"
    uniProps={theme => ({
       color: theme.colors.orange
    })}
/>
```
