There are cases where you may want to render specific components or screens with a fixed theme. For instance, a `Camera` view might require a dark background for better contrast, even if the user has selected light mode for the app. Other examples include modals, dialogs, or enabling users to preview the app in different themes to choose their preferred one.

To address this, Unistyles 3.0 introduces the concept of a `Scoped Theme`, which allows you to assign a fixed theme to a specific component or screen.

### Usage with named theme

To use scoped theme, you need to import `ScopedTheme` component from `react-native-unistyles`:

```ts
import { ScopedTheme } from 'react-native-unistyles'
```

Scoped theme accepts one of your registered theme names as a prop:

```tsx
<ScopedTheme name="dark">
    // components here will be fixed to dark theme
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
            Hello world
        </Text>
    </View>
</ScopedTheme>
```

You can also nest `ScopedTheme` components:
```tsx
<ScopedTheme name="dark">
    // I will be dark!
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
            Dark
        </Text>
    </View>
    <ScopedTheme name="light">
        // I will be light!
        <View style={styles.container}>
            <Text style={styles.text}>
                Light
            </Text>
        </View>
    </ScopedTheme>
    // I will be dark again!
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
            Dark
        </Text>
    </View>
</ScopedTheme>
```

### Usage with inverted adaptive theme


You can also use `ScopedTheme` with the `invertedAdaptive` prop. This prop cannot be used together with a named `ScopedTheme`, as these options are mutually exclusive. The purpose of `invertedAdaptive` is to apply the opposite adaptive theme to the one that is currently active.

In other words, if your app supports [adaptive themes](/v3/guides/theming#adaptive-themes) and you use `ScopedTheme` with the `invertedAdaptive` prop, it will apply:

```
the dark theme when the color scheme is light
the light theme when the color scheme is dark
```

**Use Cases**:

The `invertedAdaptive` prop is useful in scenarios where you want to highlight a specific section of your app by contrasting it with the current theme. For example:

- **Modal dialogs or popups:** Make a modal stand out by using the opposite theme, drawing the user's attention
- **Preview components:** Show users how your app looks in both light and dark modes by inverting the theme for a preview section
- **Special content areas:** Emphasize warnings, tips, or promotional banners by displaying them with a contrasting theme

By using `invertedAdaptive`, you can create visually distinct areas in your app that improve user experience and accessibility.

```tsx /invertedAdaptive/
<ScopedTheme invertedAdaptive>
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
            Text is light when color scheme is dark and dark when color scheme is light
        </Text>
    </View>
</ScopedTheme>
```

You can also nest other `ScopedThemes` inside `ScopedTheme` with `invertedAdaptive` prop.

### Reset

If you wrap multiple children in `ScopedTheme` you can disable scoped theme for some of them by using `reset` prop:

```tsx /reset/
<ScopedTheme name="dark">
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
            I will be dark!
        </Text>
    </View>
    <ScopedTheme reset>
        <View style={styles.container}>
            <Text style={styles.text}>
                I will be light again!
            </Text>
        </View>
    </ScopedTheme>
    <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
            I'm dark again
        </Text>
    </View>
</ScopedTheme>
```

### Reading current scoped theme

Information about the current `ScopedTheme` is temporary and only available during the component render phase.

For the following example, `themeName` will be different based on the place where we access it:

```tsx /themeName/
import { UnistylesRuntime, ScopedTheme } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const MyComponent = () => {
    // themeName will be 'light' here ðŸ’¥
    const themeName = UnistylesRuntime.themeName

    return (
        <ScopedTheme name="dark">
            <ScopedText>
                I'm scoped
            </ScopedText>
        </ScopedTheme>
    )
}

const ScopedText = ({ children }) => {
    // themeName will be 'dark' here âœ…
    // because we're "inside" of the ScopedTheme
    const themeName = UnistylesRuntime.themeName

    return (
        <Text style={styles.text}>
            {children}
        </Text>
    )
}
```

If you want to react to changes in the scoped theme, you can use the `useUnistyles` hook or the `withUnistyles` helper:

```tsx /useUnistyles/
import { useUnistyles, ScopedTheme } from 'react-native-unistyles'

// My parent is wrapped with ScopedTheme invertedAdaptive
const ScopedComponent = () => {
    // reading themeName from `useUnistyles` will always log
    // correctly parent scoped theme name ðŸ¤¯
    const { rt } = useUnistyles()

    return (
        <Text>
            {rt.themeName} // light for dark mode, dark for light mode
        </Text>
    )
}

// JSX
<ScopedTheme invertedAdaptive>
    <ScopedComponent />
</ScopedTheme>
```

Same goes for the `withUnistyles` helper:

```tsx /withUnistyles/
import { withUnistyles, ScopedTheme } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const ScopedTextInput = withUnistyles(TextInput, (theme, rt) => ({
    // I will always take in count parent scoped theme
    color: rt.themeName === 'light'
        ? theme.colors.text
        : theme.colors.background
}))

// My parent is wrapped with ScopedTheme invertedAdaptive
const ScopedComponent = () => {
    return (
        <ScopedTextInput />
    )
}

// JSX
<ScopedTheme invertedAdaptive>
    <ScopedComponent />
</ScopedTheme>
```
