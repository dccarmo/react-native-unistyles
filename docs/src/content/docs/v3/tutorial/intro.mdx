In this `1 hour` long tutorial, we'll build a simple, cross-platform app that targets `iOS`, `Android`, and `Web`.
Our stack will be `Expo`, `Reanimated`, and of course `Unistyles` for powerful, performant styling.

During this tutorial, we will cover most of the Unistyles features and best practices.

### Create new project

First, let's scaffold a new Expo project using the command line:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest unistyles-tutorial
cd unistyles-tutorial
```

Next, install Unistyles, its dependencies, and Reanimated:

```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-unistyles react-native-nitro-modules react-native-edge-to-edge
```

<Aside type="tip">
For best results and to ensure compatibility, we recommend using the `react-native-nitro-modules` version specified in the Unistyles
[compatibility table](https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
</Aside>

Finally, generate the native project folders required for the app to run:

```bash
yarn expo prebuild --clean
```

### Configure Babel Plugins

Both `Unistyles` and `Reanimated` require a Babel plugin to work.  Since a `babel.config.js` file isn't created by default, we can generate it by running:

```bash
npx expo customize babel.config.js
```

Now, add the `unistyles` and `reanimated` plugins to your `babel.config.js`:

```diff lang="ts"
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
+    plugins: [
+        ['react-native-unistyles/plugin', {
+            root: 'app'
+        }],
+        ['react-native-reanimated/plugin']
+    ]
  };
};
```

### Modify app entry point

To use features like themes and breakpoints, Unistyles must be configured before your application code runs.
This ensures that all stylesheets are created with the correct theme and device context.

First, update your `package.json`:

```diff lang="json"
{
-   "main": "expo-router/entry"
+   "main": "index.ts"
}
```

Next, create a new `index.ts` file in your project's root directory. This file will load the standard Expo Router entry point, and then import your Unistyles configuration:

```ts
import 'expo-router/entry'
import './unistyles'
```

We'll create the `unistyles.ts` file in the next step.

### Configure Unistyles

This is where the magic happens! Create a `unistyles.ts` file in your project's root. Here, we'll define our `themes`, `breakpoints`, and register them with Unistyles.

```ts
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native-unistyles'

const lightTheme = {
    colors: {
        background: '#FCFAF8',
        foreground: '#EDEAE6',
        typography: '#1B140C',
        dimmed: '#ECE8E4',
        tint: '#9A734C',
        activeTint: '#1B140C',
        link: '#1E3799',
        accents: {
            banana: '#F6E58D',
            pumpkin: '#FFBE76',
            apple: '#FF7979',
            grass: '#BADC58',
            storm: '#686DE0'
        }
    },
    gap: (v: number) => v * 8,
} as const

const darkTheme = {
    colors: {
        background: '#221A11',
        foreground: '#332618',
        typography: '#FFFFFF',
        dimmed: '#A8A198',
        tint: '#C9AD92',
        activeTint: '#FFFFFF',
        link: '#0C2461',
        accents: {
            banana: '#f9CA24',
            pumpkin: '#F0932B',
            apple: '#EB4D4B',
            grass: '#6AB04C',
            storm: '#4834D4'
        }
    },
    gap: (v: number) => v * 8,
} as const

const appThemes = {
    light: lightTheme,
    dark: darkTheme
}

const breakpoints = {
    xs: 0,
    sm: 300,
    md: 500,
    lg: 800,
    xl: 1200,
}

type AppBreakpoints = typeof breakpoints
type AppThemes = typeof appThemes

declare module 'react-native-unistyles' {
    export interface UnistylesThemes extends AppThemes {}
    export interface UnistylesBreakpoints extends AppBreakpoints {}
}

StyleSheet.configure({
    settings: {
        adaptiveThemes: true
    },
    themes: {
        light: lightTheme,
        dark: darkTheme,
    },
    breakpoints,
})
```

That's a lot to take in, so let's break it down:

**Themes**: We defined light and dark themes. There are no restrictions on a theme's structure, you can add any properties you need, from colors to spacing functions.
In our case we defined a custom palette with different accents and one helper function `gap` for spacing.

**Breakpoints**: We defined a set of breakpoints for responsive design. The only requirement is that one breakpoint must be 0.

**Types**: We extended the Unistyles module with our custom `AppThemes` and `AppBreakpoints` types. This is the key to unlocking full auto-completion and type-safety across your entire app.

**Configuration**: Finally, we called the `StyleSheet.configure` function to set all the options. We also enabled `adaptiveThemes`, which will cause Unistyles to automatically transition between themes based on device color scheme.
